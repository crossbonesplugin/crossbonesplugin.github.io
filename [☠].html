<p>Hey! First of all, I just want to congratulate you on decrypting the link(s) in the plugin. The encryption was tricky enough to implement, so the fact that you're even here is impressive. Don't worry, you're not in danger or trouble, and everything's gonna be okay.</p>

<p>So, you're clearly proficient or better in Java, to use my own tools against me. It probably doesn't need to be said, but this plugin wasn't meant for someone like you. You've stumbled upon a curious Java developer's innocent labor of love and series of scientific experiments. If you have gotten so far as to reach this page, you must have deduced by now that this plugin offers a range of secret features to those privy to its verification routine. This is understandably concerning or even frightening and I would like to ease your concerns before I continue.</p>

<p>Firstly, <em><strong>my intentions are pure</strong></em> in creating this software. Although some features of this plugin could totally be used for harm, they are not and never will be, except for very specific circumstances wherein a server owner is a total despicable, oppressive, and abusive shithead — not counting justified punishments of course. For instance, a server owner once detailed to me his abusive relationship with his girlfriend, and threatened to blackmail a player he knew personally if that player were to cheat in-game. You're probably not this kind of person, so don't worry. I have a number of safeguards in place to keep this situation from going wrong. All players with knowledge of this plugin have been vetted and informed that they are not to use it for harmful purposes. These are people I trust — people that do not get off from ruining other peoples' day, and that won't act out if they're rightfully punished. Furthermore, I reserve the ability and the right to remove the plugin and/or its functionality whenever I suspect that things may get out of hand.</p>

<p>The secret features of the plugin are protected behind a verification command designed so that it will never be accidentally entered. This means that <em><strong>no</strong></em> players will be able to use it unless they are fully aware of its presence. Hell, even if you’ve verified on purpose, a totally separate non-slash prefix is used for the secret commands. This prefix is not mentioned in-game anywhere until a player successfully executes a secret command. All of this said, I obviously don't expect you to still use the plugin, I just want you to understand where I'm coming from.</p>

<p>I cannot stress enough that <em><strong>this plugin is no more than an educational experiment</strong></em> of my own and others, and  <em><strong>we have no intention to grief, manipulate your server(s) in any harmful way, destroy — or even leave a trace on — systems of any kind.</strong></em> In the past, I have even used this plugin to improve servers in small, non-intrusive ways, but that's not the point.</p>

<p>You've probably been offered this plugin by a friend of mine. I don't even play Minecraft much anymore, but I have not released the plugin publicly and I ask respectfully that you don't either in order to maintain the integrity of other servers. If you intend to use it for yourself, I may not be able to stop you immediately, but I will probably try. My friends won't have seen the source of the plugin, only been given the obfuscated/encrypted version and taught how to use it. They are all mature, friendly players, college age, more often than not with an interest in psychology and sociology. They intend to have harmless fun and conduct experiments with the plugin commands, and maybe, at worst, spawn themselves the occasional item they can't be bothered to fetch for themselves. This is not at the expense of your server’s integrity, but rather maybe your trust in me or my friend(s).</p>

<p>If you disapprove of this plugin’s presence on the server, then I suggest that, instead of banning the players on the trusted list (considering they are not the only players aware of the plugin's presence, the only ones able to verify, or people with bad intentions in the first place) removing the verification command and making it only possible for specific players. This way, you may still enjoy the features I have created, while not leaving a vulnerability open in your server. I recommend the commands <strong>ride</strong>, <strong>magnet</strong>, and <strong>mine</strong>. I’m really proud of those and I think you’re going to enjoy them a lot.</p>

<p>Please have an amazing day and keep being a fantastic developer and administrator.</p>
